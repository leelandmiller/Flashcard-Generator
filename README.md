# Flashcard-Generator

## A very basic backend API for a flashcard-generator app

### As of now, the app can generate two flashcard variants:

* **Basic Card:** Has a Front (*Question*) and Back (*Answer*)
   - Ex Front: `Who was the first President of the United States?`
   - Ex Back: `George Washington`

* **Cloze-Deleted Card:** Has a Front (*Question*) and Back (*Answer*)<br>
**Cloze Deleted** is just a sentence with some of its text removed.

   * Ex Front: `... was the first President of the United States.`
   * Ex Back: `George Washington`
